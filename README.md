# Masters-Thesis-Scents-in-VR

A virtual environment made for Master's thesis experiment. The virtual environment was made with Unity and C#. The virtual reality system used was Valve Index. The interaction happened with a headset and a controller.

The environment consisted of a corridor with walls and 12 closed boxes with 12 different objects inside. The participant could move from one box to another by teleportation. The participants were instructed to open the boxes by touching them with their virtual hand. Once the box was open, the object inside was to be picked up and moved in the air for a closer examination. The object was then placed back inside the box and the box was closed by touching it with the virtual hand again. An olfactory display produced different smells according to the objects examined.
